# DNA Sequence Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify DNA sequences into different categories (promoter regions, coding sequences, or regulatory elements).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
## Usage
Run the main script: python dna_sequence_classifier.py

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Two 1D convolutional layers
- Two max pooling layers
- A flatten layer
- Two dense layers

## Data
This example uses generated sample data. For real-world applications, replace the `generate_sample_data` function with your own data loading mechanism.

## Results
The model's performance can be evaluated using the printed test accuracy and sample prediction.

## Future Improvements
- Use real DNA sequence data
- Experiment with different model architectures
- Implement cross-validation
- Add data visualization for model performance
